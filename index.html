The three largest groups of latinos are those who identify as being of Mexican origin, Puerto Ricans, and of Cuban origin. </p>

  <p>More than half of the U.S. Hispanic population resides in three states: <em>California, Texas, and Florida.</em> These are followed by New York and Illinois.</p>

  <p>California has the nation’s largest Hispanic population, with about 14.4 million Hispanics. New Mexico is the state with the largest share of Latinos: there, they make up 46.7% of the state's population. Maine, West Virginia, and Vermont have the lowest Hispanic population shares with 1% each. </p>

    <p>In spite of the current political narrative used by some politicians, <strong>fewer Mexicans are migrating to the U.S.</strong> today than in the past. In fact, more Mexicans left than came to the U.S since the end of the Great Recession. </p>
    <p>According to the Pew Research Center, between 2009 and 2014, 870,000 Mexican nationals left Mexico to come to the U.S., down from the 2.9 million who left Mexico for the U.S. between 1995 and 2000.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="miss-text2">
  <p>This is due to several reasons including the slow recovery of the U.S. economy after the 2008 economic crisis, the deterioration of the U.S. job market, and stricter enforcement of U.S. Immigration laws -particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border and in terms of deportations- for this phenomenon.</p>

  <p> People who identify as Mexican in the US tend to consistently vote for <strong>democratic candidates</strong>. In the 2016, over 66% of Latino voters chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, according to <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/29/hillary-clinton-wins-latino-vote-but-falls-below-2012-support-for-obama/">exit poll data. </a> Nevertheless, close to 29% of Latinos supported Donald Trump -a number higher than the one acquired by Republican 2012 Candidate Mitt Romney. </p>
  <p>  Trump’s stance where particualy seen as anti-Mexican and anti-immigrant. Throughout the campaign season he called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and "criminals", and called for a wall on the southern border, seemingly energizing the community against him.</p>

  <p>Puerto Ricans are concentrated in the Northeast, around 21 percent live in  in New York, and in the South, mostly in Florida (19%). </p>
  <p> In the last decades, Central Florida has become the preferred migration destination for many Puerto Ricans. In 2015, there were more than a million islanders in Florida, a number that has doubled since 2001, driven largely until now by a failing economy. Orlando is becoming the mecca for many <em>boricuas.</em> </p>

<div id="priss">

    <p> The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been a United States territoriy since 1898, and Puerto Ricans have been American citizens since the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917. However, they possess their own local government and constitution. For that reason, they are technically not considered immigrants, as they are often entitled to the benefits and security that is reserved for native-born americans, especially when they move to the mainland. Historically, New York City has been the main destiny for Puerto Ricans in the United States, there they make up 33% of the state’s Hispanic population. Nevertheless, many of them experience some of the struggles characteristic of other latino communities. </p>

    <p> Puerto Rico has been facing a grave economic crisis for years now. This has been attributed to various factors, such government’s overspending, and some laws passed by the US Congress in the last few years. US Census data shows that roughly 46 percent of Puerto Ricans currently live under the poverty line. The unemployment rate is over 11 percent, almost three times higher than in US mainland. For that reason, more than 700,000 islanders left the island for the mainland between 2006 and 2015. </p>


        <p>In the wake of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, which left a large part of the caribbean island destroyed and without power and water for months, hundreds of thousands Puerto Ricans have migrated to the U.S mainland- a movement larger than any other in the history of Puerto Rico. Officials estimate that over 300,000 Puerto Ricans will migrate to  </p>

  <p> The Puerto Rican vote has been traditionally strongly democratic. Puerto Ricans in the island are not eligible to vote on Presidential Elections - however, they do in the primaries. </p>
  <p> Puerto Ricans in the mainland have historically supported democrats. In 2016, they overwhelmingly supported Democratic Candidate Hillary Clinton. </p>


  <p>With more people moving from the island to continental United States -most specifically Florida- due to the island's economic crisis and Hurricane Maria, they could become key voters in swing states. Just in Central Florida, over 350,000 Puerto Ricans have settled in the last few years, becoming a political force as determinant as Cubans in Miami. </p>

    <p> Because of the problematic relationship the United States and Cuba, Cubans have -historically- had a different migration experience to the U.S than the majority of other latinos. Thanks to different policies, many cubans were granted many benefits other immigrants could only dream of.</p>

  <p>Things, however, began to change in 2014, when President Barack Obama announced the end of the embargo, and the renewal of ties with Cuba. Among the politics taken where opening a U.S embassy in the island and allowing U.S touristic travel. </p>
