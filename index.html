<h1>Latinos in the United States</h1>
<h2>A Force Awakening </h2>

<h4>For decades, Latinos have been reshaping the United States.</h4>
<h4> Today, they are the largest minority in the country: according to the Pew Research Center, there were over 56 million Hispanics in the United States in 2015, accounting for 17.6% of the total U.S. population. </h4>

<h4> But Latinos are a diverse community, with people coming from a variety of countries and walks of life, resulting in a range of characteristics, interests, and struggles. </h4>

<p> The Census Bureau estimates that by 2060, Latinos will comprise 28% of the total population of the United States.</p>

<p> The three largest groups of latinos are those who identify as being of Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. </p>

<p>More than half of the U.S. Hispanic population resides in three states: California, Texas, and Florida. These are followed by New York and Illinois. California has the nation’s largest Hispanic population, with about 14.4 million Hispanics.</p>

<p>New Mexico is the state with the largest share of Latinos: there, they make up 46.7% of state's population. </p>

<div class="mexicanbox" id="mex-im">
  <p><strong>Fewer Mexicans are migrating to the U.S.</strong> today than in the past. In fact, more Mexicans left than came to the U.S since the end of the Great Recession. </p>
  <p>According to the Pew Research Center, between 2009 and 2014, 870,000 Mexican nationals left Mexico to come to the U.S., down from the 2.9 million who left Mexico for the U.S. between 1995 and 2000.</p>
<p>This is due to several reasons. Some experts cite factors such as the slow recovery of the U.S. economy after the 2008 economic crisis, the deterioration of the U.S. job market, and stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws -particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border and in terms of deportations- for this phenomenon.</p>

<ul>
<li> Puerto Ricans are the second-largest Hispanic origin population living in the United States, accounting for 9.5% of the U.S. Hispanic population. </li>
  <li>A little over five million latinos of Puerto Rican origins live in mainland United States, while the population of the caribbean island was 3.4 million in 2016.  </li>
<li>Puerto Ricans born and living on the mainland have a higher level of education and income than those still living in the island. </li>

  <h3 class="carheadings">Immigration</h3>

  <p> The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been a United States territoriy 1898, and Puerto Ricans have been American citizens since the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917. However, they possess their own local government and constitution. For that reason, they are technically not considered immigrants, as they are often entitled to the benefits and security that is reserved for native-born americans, especially when they move to the mainland.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, many of them experience some of the struggles characteristic of other latino communities, in terms of language, poverty level, and reasons for migrating. </p>


      <p>Historically, New York City has been the main destiny for Puerto Ricans in the United States, there they make up 33% of the state’s Hispanic population.</p>

      <p> There are more than a million Puerto Ricans in Florida, a number that has doubled since 2001, driven largely until now by a failing economy.</p>

<div class="prbox" id="pr-vot">
  <h3 class="carheadings">Voting Tendencies</h3>
<p> The Puerto Rican vote has been traditionally strongly democratic. Puerto Ricans in the island are not eligible to vote on Presidential Elections - however, they do in the primaries. </p>
<p> Puerto Ricans in the mainland have historically supported democrats. In 2016, they overwhelmingly supported Democratic Candidate Hillary Clinton. </p>


<p>With more people moving from the island to continental United States -most specifically Florida- due to the island's economic crisis and Hurricane Maria, they could become key voters in swing states. Just in Central Florida, over 350,000 Puerto Ricans have settled in the last few years, becoming a political force as determinant as Cubans in Miami. </p>
