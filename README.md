# latinos_usa

Week 1

This week I worked mostly on the research and set up the basic structure of the app. Also, I decided to work on the interactive maps first as I realized that could be one of the most challenging parts of this project. 
For a few days, I had issues with the main U.S map - the choropleth map. The map is meant to tell you what's the number of latino people in each state of the United States, when you hover over each state, as well as show where they are mostly concentrated. At the beginning, I had trouble with the population values so these would show up mixed up, or wouldn't show up at all. After a few tries, I was able to get it done. I'm really happy with the outcome! Although I plan on changing the colors. I used this tutorial for the choropleth map. 
Aditionally, I also decided to work on the location maps for each group - with the markers on where they are mostly concentrated. 

In terms of content, I wrote most of it this week, setting up each catergory that I mean to explore. The write up is not perfect yet, but that is something I mean to focus next week as I changed the order up a bit.
