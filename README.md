# latinos_usa

Week 1

This week I worked mostly on the research and set up the basic structure of the app. Also, I decided to work on the interactive maps first as I realized that could be one of the most challenging parts of this project.
For a few days, I had issues with the main U.S map - the choropleth map. The map is meant to tell you what's the number of latino people in each state of the United States, when you hover over each state, as well as show where they are mostly concentrated. At the beginning, I had trouble with the population values so these would show up mixed up, or wouldn't show up at all. After a few tries, I was able to get it done. I'm really happy with the outcome! Although I plan on changing the colors. I used this tutorial for the choropleth map: http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/.
Aditionally, I also decided to work on the location maps for each group this week - with the markers on where each community is mostly concentrated. Mostly because I wanted to see how it looked and thought it would help me explain the location section better.

In terms of content, I wrote most of it this week, setting up each category. The write up is not perfect yet, but that is something I mean to focus next week as I changed the order up a bit.


Week 2


I finished all my maps, charts and mostly focused on finishing the timelines, which took me a while. This week, I decided to start working on the CSS even though I had originally planned to do that next week. I realized I may not need as much Javascript as I thought I did, and it helps me visualize just in what ways I need to slide the sections.

 I've been having trouble making some of the buttons work and with their positions in the slides. They are all over the place, so I'm working on fixing that.  I was not able to make the page as interactive as I would have liked this week, but I think it's coming together well. I think I may change the red color of the Puerto Ricans section as it is too bright.


 Week 3

 I struggled a lot, and I mean, a lot with the buttons. After a few trials, I was able to figure out what was wrong and made them work. This week, I mostly worked on fixing those issues, the locations of the buttons, and completing the CSS & Java. I also finished the "about this page" and reworded a few of the slides. I also added slideToggle in a few slides' paragraphs.

 I still need to work on my media query to make the page's interactivity more effective in other devices, which I'll do this weekend. Some of my sections are tied to the height 100vh, which I'll need to change in the media queary. I also plan on altering the first three slides under LatinDiv. I think scrolling and then sliding to the side may be a bit confusing for the user. So I intend to put a few buttons instead of the arrow at the beginning so it's all sliding.
 The footer is acting up in some of the pages, so I will work on fixing that as well.
